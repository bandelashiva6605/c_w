# UpkillCampus
## Title: Crop-And-Weed-Detection

## Overview
Welcome to the Crop and Weed Detection repository! This open-source project is dedicated to advancing precision agriculture through computer vision and machine learning. Our goal is to automate the detection of crops and weeds in agricultural fields, empowering farmers to make data-driven decisions for better yields and sustainability.

### Features
- **Crop Detection:** Our model accurately identifies various crop types, including corn, wheat, rice, and more, enabling precise monitoring and management.
- **Weed Detection:** Detect and classify common weeds, allowing farmers to target and eliminate them efficiently.
- **Real-time Processing:** Our algorithms are optimized for real-time processing, making it suitable for integration with drones and other autonomous agricultural equipment.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashwanthreddy28/upskillcampus

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd upskillcampus
   
3. Install the project dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Project Structure
- **dataset/:** Contains the datasets of crops and weeds for the crop and weed detection models.
- **test/:** Contains the images of crops and weeds for Testing or Prediction.
- **requirements.txt:** Contains the required libraries to download.
- **TrainDataSet.py:** Contains the code to create X.npy and Y.npy files.
- **CropAndWeedDetection.py:** Contains the actual code to predict the crop or weed.
- **CropAndWeedDetection_Yashwanth_USC_UCT.pdf:** Documentation for the project.

### Running the Project
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. **Generate Dataset Files**:
   - First, you need to generate the dataset files `X.npy` and `Y.npy` by running the [TrainDataSet](https://github.com/yashwanthreddy28/upskillcampus/blob/main/TrainDataSet.py) script.
2. **Run CropAndWeedDetection.py**:
   - After generating the dataset files, you can run the [CropAndWeedDetection](https://github.com/yashwanthreddy28/upskillcampus/blob/main/CropAndWeedDetection.py) script to perform further analysis.
